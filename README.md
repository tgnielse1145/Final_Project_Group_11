# Final Project Group 11

## IIR Filters
This section has no code but instead has a write-up for the PreLab.
## S-9: Interference Removal from Electro-Cardiogram (ECG) Signals
To run the code, navigate to the Lab_Exercise folder in MATLAB and run the Lab_Exercise.m script. This project focuses on designing and analyzing IIR filters, including allpass and notch filters, for signal processing applications.

## Mini Project 05
To run the code, navigate to the mini_project_5 folder in MATLAB and run the mp05.m script. This script plots an example IIR filter and then reads through the included files and identifies the frequency of the note in each one.
## Mini Project 06
To run the code you will have to open Q_miniProj6.m in matlab. Then you will have to download the original audio AuntRhody.wav file. Then you will have to change the file path whenever an audioread or audiowrite is called.
